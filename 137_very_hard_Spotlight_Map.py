Spotlight Map
Given a grid of numbers, return a grid of the Spotlight Sum of each number. The spotlight sum can be defined as the total of all numbers immediately surrounding the number on the grid, including the number in the total.

Examples
spotlight_map([
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]) ➞ [
  [12, 21, 16],
  [27, 45, 33],
  [24, 39, 28]
]


spotlight_map([
  [2, 6, 1, 3, 7],
  [8, 5, 9, 4, 0]
]) ➞ [
  [21, 31, 28, 24, 14],
  [21, 31, 28, 24, 14]
]


spotlightMap([[3]]) ➞ [[3]]
Notes
Note that all numbers have a spotlight sum, including numbers on the edges.
All inputs will be valid grid (all rows will have the same length).
