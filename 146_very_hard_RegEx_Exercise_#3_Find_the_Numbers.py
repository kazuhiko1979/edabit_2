RegEx Exercise #3: Find the Numbers
Write five regular expressions:

One called integers that will match all whole numbers, positive or negative.
One called floats that will match all decimal numbers, positive or negative.
One called positive that will match all positive numbers, whole or decimal.
One called negative that will match all negative numbers, whole or decimal.
One called numbers that will match all numbers, whole or decimal, positive or negative.
Details to take into account:

Fractions of 1 may or may not be preceded by a 0. All 0.5, .5, -.5 and are valid numbers.
Floats will have at least one decimal number. Both 4. and -3. are not valid numbers.
Positives numbers may or may not be preceded by a +. Both 3 and +3 are valid numbers.
Numbers preceded by more than one symbol or having more than one decimal point are no considered valid. All ++1, -+4, 3.3.6 are not valid numbers.
All numbers, valid or not, will be preceded and followed by a whitespace.
Example
txt = " 123.456 2 +7 -88 -.25 9.10.11 -4. +-34 -0.6 --5 "
integers = "yourregularexpressionhere"
floats = "yourregularexpressionhere"
positive = "yourregularexpressionhere"
negative = "yourregularexpressionhere"
numbers = "yourregularexpressionhere"

re.findall(integers, txt) ➞ ["2", "+7", "-88"]
re.findall(floats, txt) ➞ ["123.456", "-.25", "-0.6"]
re.findall(positive, txt) ➞ ["123.456", "2", "+7"]
re.findall(negative, txt) ➞ ["-88", "-.25", "-0.6"]
re.findall(numbers, txt) ➞ ["123.456", "2", "+7", "-88", "-.25", "-0.6"]
Notes
You don't need to write a function, just the pattern.
Do not remove import re from the code.
If you get stuck, check Comments for some helpful hints.
